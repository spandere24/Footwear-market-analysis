**Approach for creating the Dashboard**

I designed this interactive dashboard to analyze footwear pricing trends, brand discount strategies, and consumer preferences, enabling data-driven decision-making. Leveraging Power Query, I cleaned and transformed the dataset, ensuring data accuracy and consistency. Using DAX measures, I calculated discount percentages, max/min discounts, and total product counts, providing key performance insights. The dashboard features bar charts, pie charts, KPI cards, and a matrix table, with interactive slicers for filtering by brand, color, size, and discount %, allowing for dynamic exploration. Conditional formatting and drill-through functionality enhance usability, making it easy to identify pricing trends and high-discount brands. Optimized for performance, the dashboard delivers real-time business intelligence, helping stakeholders refine pricing strategies and improve sales performance.
